# Word-Guess-Game

This is a take on the 80's word guess game.

I used retro games as the base, and used a couple new CSS effects to give that true retro feel.

I made a concious effort to ignore bootstrap in favor of builing a custom, mobile-first, layout for the game. As a result, I ended up running out of time to give it alternate views highlighting the flexbox model.

As a bonus, I made an "animated" effect with pacman ghosts encircling pacman. 

The ultimate goal would be to:
    add a more satisfying win/lose image
    add some music in the background
    additionally, I would like to show the game box art/play its theme in the background until the next win
